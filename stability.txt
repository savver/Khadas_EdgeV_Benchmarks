1) USB:
   write/read big files during long time, check error messages in dmesg,
   check cpu temperature
   
		 dd if=/dev/urandom of=/mnt/usb/file6_3G bs=1M count=3072
		 dd if=/mnt/usb/file6_3G of=/dev/null bs=1M count=3072
		
2) ethernet
	iperf3 in TCP forward/reverse modes, during long times (some hours, some days),
	check "retries", error messages in dmesg, speed during whole test, cpu temperature
	
	iperf3 -c 192.168.0.99 -t 20000
	iperf3 -c 192.168.0.99 -R -t600
	iperf3 -c 192.168.0.99 -V -t360; cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone*/temp
	
		1 time was message in dmesg "BUG: spinlock wrong CPU on CPU#2, dhd_dpc/375", 
		but iperf3 test continue
		
2.1) stfp via ethernet, copying from SSD to host PC during long time,
     check speed during whole test, files checksums, errors in dmesg
